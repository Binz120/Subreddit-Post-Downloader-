## API Compliance

- **Respect Reddit's API Rules:**
  - The script uses a default limit of approximately 60 requests per minute.
  - Automatic rate limiting is implemented to handle API constraints.
  - For large-scale operations, consider adding manual delays to ensure compliance.
  - **Note:** Do not collect personal or private data. Always adhere to Reddit's API policies.
